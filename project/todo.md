### Todo List

#### Requirements

The purpose of this project is to create a feature-full todo list command line app. A user can enter commands to manipulate their todo list(s).

You application should have the following properites:

#### Requirements

* Does not crash.

#### Features

* Create lists
* Add an item to a list
* Delete an item from a list
* Mark an item as "done"
* Edit an item
* Set priority on items (1 - 4; default = 1);
* List active (not marked done) items in list
* List inactive (marked done) items in list

#### Bonus

* Add a due date to an item
  * Show items that are overdue
  * sort by due date 
* Parse natural language eg. “mark running done”

**Other considerations:**
* Look around at some other to-do list apps. Implement any features that you find interesting.

Submit your projects by July 1st at 10:00pm. Submit your projects by adding a link to your repo below. Include
in your README instructions for using your app.

We will have demos in class on Thursday July 2nd. I will probably ask your team one or two technical questions based
on your source.
